GitHub template for a new repository using Read the Docs
========================================================
Orginaly setup from Graziella, making use of some Python
examples, .rst and .toml files.

.rst: https://g.co/kgs/TJ6fbQ
.toml: https://g.co/kgs/ajqeRt

This GitHub template includes some basic Sphinx docs.
Sphinx: https://g.co/kgs/h9ZL2a

The primary goal is to investigate how to create a GitHub
template repository that will setup a docs structure when
a new repository is created.

I leave the use of these files intact to start with, but
will probably change some of them to for example MarkDown
